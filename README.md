# FuzzyModel

This repository contains the files from an assignment (Assignment1_22_23.pdf) in which one should implement the model presented in the paper "A simple but powerful heuristic method for generating fuzzy rules from numerical data" (Nozaki et al., 1997). 
While the .py-file contains the main part of the work, the matlab file contains the fuzzy setting with which the implementation was tested. The Report.pdf-file contains the report of the implementation.
